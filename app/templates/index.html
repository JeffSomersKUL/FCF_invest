                    To ensure seamless operations within our investment club, 
                    we have implemented a series of measures. Firstly, we 
                    distinguish our <span id="members" class="highlight-text">members</span> based on their level of 
                    commitment and willingness to participate in discussions. 
                    Accordingly, we provide tailored types of <span id="presentations" class="highlight-text">presentations</span> on 
                    a weekly rotating basis. In addition to the presentations, 
                    we utilize Discord as our primary <span id="communication" class="highlight-text">communication</span> platform, 
                    with support from Messenger, Drive, and email. This enables effective communication and collaboration 
                    among our members. Lastly, we provide weekly updates to our <span id="porftolio" class="highlight-text">portfolio</span> to keep our members informed and enable them
                    to track their investment progress.

                                Active meetings, on the other hand, are less structured and allow for pitches to be made

                                These meetings are geared more towards the active members of the club who are actively 
                                engaged in trading.
